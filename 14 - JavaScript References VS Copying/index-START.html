        //Good to know! Calling another variable to create a new one makes a copy, but calling an array or object to create a new one makes a REFERENCE. There are lots of ways around this, for arrays, but I like Array.from() the best. For objects we're looking at Object.assign({}, firstObject, {newAttribute: value}). Also learned the poor-man's deep clone via JSON parse & stringify

        // start with strings, numbers and booleans

        //These variables match when the second is set
        //but when the first variable is changed
        //the second one isn't affected

        // let age = 100;
        // let age2 = age;

        // console.log(age, age2);

        // age = 200;

        // console.log(age, age2);

        // let name = "Carolyn";
        // let name2 = name;

        // console.log(name, name2)

        // name = "Paul";

        // console.log(name, name2)

        // Let's say we have an array
        // const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

        // and we want to make a copy of it.
        // const team = players;

        // console.log(players, team);

        // You might think we can just do something like this:

        // team[3] = "Lux";
        // console.log(players, team);

        // however what happens when we update that array?

        // now here is the problem!

        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

        // one way

        // const team2 = players.slice();
        // if you pass slice nothing, you get a copy of the whole array

        // or create a new array and concat the old one in

        // const team2 = [].concat(players);

        // or use the new ES6 Spread

        // const team = [...players];

        // const team5 = Array.from(players);

        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

        // with Objects
        const person = {
            name: 'Wes Bos',
            age: 80
        };

        // and think we make a copy:

        const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {
            number: 99
        });


        // how do we take a copy instead?

        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

        //POOR MAN'S DEEP CLONE

        const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
